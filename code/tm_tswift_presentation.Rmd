```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=6, fig.height=4) 
```


```{r import, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
# Source packages
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(tm)
library(topicmodels)
library(highcharter)

# Load data and stopwords
dat <- read.csv("taylor_swift_lyrics.csv")
dat$lyric <- as.character(dat$lyric)
data("stop_words")

```

## Introduction
* I'm working to expand my data science portfolio

* This analysis reviews Taylor Swift's song lyrics

* Song lyrics data come from Kaggle.com

## Background

``` {r image, out.width = "150px", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Taylor_Swift_Cavendish.jpg")
```

* Taylor Swift started out as a country singer, but made the transition to pop music around 2010

* Her breakout song is "You Belong With Me"

* Her most recent album was released in 2017

## Goals
This analysis seeks to answer the following questions:

1. Did the length of Taylor's songs change over time?
2. Did the complexity of her songs change over time?
3. Do Taylor's songs tend to coalesce around a few topics? If so, how might we charcterize those topics? 
4. Does a trend exist between song topic and song year released?

```{r preprocessing, echo = FALSE, include= FALSE}

# New data frame where all the songs have one row, instead of a row for each sentence
datV2 <- dat %>% group_by(track_title) %>%
  summarise(text = paste(lyric, collapse = " "))

# Initial pre-processing steps: lowering words and removing stopwords
datV2 <- datV2 %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  group_by(track_title) %>%
  nest(word) %>%
  mutate(text = map(data, unlist), 
         text = map_chr(text, paste, collapse = " ")) %>%
  select(-data)

datV2$text <- tolower(datV2$text)

# Merge in the year of the songs
years <- unique(dplyr::select(dat, year, track_title))
datV2 <- merge(datV2, years, by="track_title")
```

## Summary statistics

1. How many records are in the data? 

```{r length, echo = FALSE}
nrow(dat)
```


2. Is Taylor Swift the only artist represented in the data?

```{r artist, echo = FALSE}
unique(dat$artist)
```

3. How many songs are in the data?

```{r songs, echo = FALSE}
length(unique(dat$track_title))
```

## Pre-processing

* In text analysis, it's common to pre-process data in the following ways:
    + Remove stopwords (such as "and," "the," "you")
    + Retrieve word stems (to remove different tenses of words)
    + Remove special characters (accents, images, etc)
* The data came as one row for each song lyric, so I collapse the data into one row per song

## 1. Average word count per song has increased steadily over the years
```{r songlength, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
  # Determine wordcounts
data.songlength.1 <- datV2 %>% 
                      unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
#                      anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
                      group_by(track_title, year) %>%
                      count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
                      summarise(total_count = sum(n))
plotting <- data.songlength.1 %>%
              group_by(year) %>%
              summarise(average_wc = mean(total_count))
  # Plot results
highchart(width = "600px", height = "400px") %>% 
  hc_title(text = "Average Song Word Count by Year") %>%
  hc_xAxis(categories = plotting$year) %>%
  hc_add_series(name = "Word Count", data = plotting$average_wc, color="#815BFF") %>%
  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_flat())
```

## 1. The distribution of word counts by song is more spread out over time

```{r boxplot1, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
hcboxplot(x = data.songlength.1$total_count, var = data.songlength.1$year, color = "#815BFF",
          outliers = FALSE) %>% 
  hc_title(text = "Distribution of Word Count by Year and Song") %>%
  hc_chart(type = "column") %>%
  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_flat()) %>%
  hc_size(width = "600px", height = "400px") %>%
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Year"))
         
```

## 2. Visualizing song complexity over time

I define "song complexity" as the number of unique non-stopword words per song. I look at song complexity from two different angles: 

1. On average, how many unique words appear per song per album?
2. On average, how many times is a word repeated per song?

```{r complexity1, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data.songlength.2 <- datV2 %>% 
                  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
                  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
                  group_by(track_title, year) %>%
                  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
                  summarise(num_distinct = n_distinct(word))
  # Plotting (1)
plotting <- data.songlength.2 %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(average_unq = mean(num_distinct))
  # Plot results
# highchart() %>% 
#   hc_title(text = "Unique Words in Songs by Year") %>%
#   hc_xAxis(categories = plotting$year) %>%
#   hc_add_series(name = "Average Number of Unique Words", data = plotting$average_unq, color="#815BFF") %>%
#   hc_add_theme(hc_theme_flat())

```


## 2. The distribution of unique words in songs gets tighter over time

```{r boxplot2, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
hcboxplot(x = data.songlength.2$num_distinct, var = data.songlength.2$year, color = "#815BFF",
          outliers = FALSE) %>% 
  hc_title(text = "Distribution of Unique Words by Year and Song") %>%
  hc_chart(type = "column") %>%
  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_flat()) %>%
  hc_size(width = "600px", height = "400px") %>%
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Year"))
```

## 2. Word repetition was at its highest in 2014

```{r complexity2, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data.songlength.3 <- datV2 %>% 
                  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
                  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
                  group_by(track_title, year) %>%
                  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
                  summarise(average_rep = mean(n))

  # Plotting (2)
plotting <- data.songlength.3 %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(average_rep = mean(average_rep))

hcboxplot(x = data.songlength.3$average_rep, var = data.songlength.3$year, color = "#815BFF", outliers = FALSE) %>% 
  hc_title(text = "Distribution of Word Repetition by Year and Song") %>%
  hc_chart(type = "column") %>%
  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_flat()) %>%
  hc_size(width = "600px", height = "400px") %>%
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Year"))

```

## 3. Analyzing song topics over time

* Does Taylor Swift really sing about the same things over and over?

* I use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to pull out topics from the text

* LDA is a generative probabilistic model commonly used to model topics in documents

* LDA assigns probabilities to a word falling under a given topic, and to a topic being assigned to a given document

## 3. Each topic refers to a type of song within Taylor's portfolio

``` {r terms, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
k <- 5 
ldaOut.terms <- read.csv(file=paste("LDAGibbs_k=",k,"_TopicsToTerms.csv"))

ldaOut.terms <- ldaOut.terms[,1:length(ldaOut.terms)]

ldaOut.terms

```

## Conclusion

* Looking into the data mostly confirmed my prior beliefs about Taylor's music

* The data does show that Taylor's songs became wordier over time, but seem to suffer from the "song compression" phenomenon

* I hope this analysis inspires you to take a deep dive into the parts of culture you most enjoy
