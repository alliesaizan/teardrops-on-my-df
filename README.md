# A Topic Modelling Analysis of Taylor Swift Song Lyrics üé§

I was browsing Kaggle for an interesting dataset when I ran across a
[library of Taylor Swift‚Äôs
songs](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/taylor-swift-song-lyrics-from-all-the-albums).

Usually when I find data on Kaggle, it‚Äôs been picked over and analyzed
all sort of ways. But luckily for me, only one person had analyzed these
data! I guess data scientists aren‚Äôt much into pop culture (or data not
associated with million-dollar competitions).

I thought it might be fun to look for patterns in Taylor‚Äôs music. My
running theory for the past decade is that Taylor‚Äôs songs all sound the
same. Would the data bear that pattern out?

Speficially, this analysis seeks to answer the following questions:

1.  Did the length of Taylor‚Äôs songs change over time?
2.  Did the complexity of songs change over time?
3.  Do Taylor‚Äôs songs tend to coalesce around a few topics? If so, how
    might we charcterize those topics?
4.  Does a trend exist between song topic and song year released?

Before we dive into the analysis, let‚Äôs run a few quality checks on the
data.

1.  How many records do we have here?

<!-- -->

    ## [1] 7

1.  Is Taylor Swift the only artist represented in the data?

<!-- -->

    ## [1] "Taylor Swift"

Oh good, yes she is.

1.  Which songs are in the data?

The data needs pre-processing, which includes removing stopwords and
special characters and coercing every word to lowercase. Removing
stopwords is a typical natural language processing task, but it gives me
some anxiety because some of Taylor‚Äôs most prominent songs (such as ‚ÄúYou
Belong With Me‚Äù) contain stopwords that impact song meaning (‚ÄúYou‚Äù,
‚ÄúWith‚Äù, ‚ÄúMe‚Äù).

In the original dataset, every row contains one song lyric, which is not
ideal from a data tidyness point of view. The steps are hidden from
view, but I end up with a reshaped dataset.

    ## Joining, by = "word"

## Question 1: Visualizing song length over time

I‚Äôm interpreting song length as the number of unique tokens in a song.
Below, I plot the trend of average song length over the years.

The graph above shows that the average word count in Taylor‚Äôs songs have
increased rather steadily over the years.

This chart does not account for within-year variation. It‚Äôs entirely
possible that a few songs had high word count in the later years of
Taylor‚Äôs career, which brought the average up. Let‚Äôs look at that
within-year variation.

The distribution of word counts by song becomes more spread out over the
years. Interestingly, small word-count songs get larger as time goes on
as well, which suggests that the widening distributions are driven by
greater wordiness and not a greater spread over word count length.
Taylor released her wordiest songs in 2017. Is this trend a sign that
Taylor‚Äôs songs are getting more intricate or complex over time?

## Question 2: Visualizing song complexity over time

I define ‚Äúsong conplexity‚Äù as the number of unique non-stopword words
per song. I look at song complexity from two differnet angles:

1.  On average, how many unique words appear per song per year?
2.  On average, how many times is a word repeated per song?

The chart above shows that Taylor reached her greatest lexical
complecity in 2010. 2010 roughly marks Taylor‚Äôs transition from a
country music artist to a pop artist. The most notable trend is that as
Taylor‚Äôs songs skewed more heavily toward the pop music genre, the
number of unique words in songs decreased. But again, looking at
averages doesn‚Äôt get us very far, so let‚Äôs take a gander at boxplots.

The distribution of unique words in songs over the years is quite
similar, but gets tighter over time.

    ## Joining, by = "word"

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'track_title'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

Word repetition increased dramatically after 2010, and was at its
highest in 2014. In 2014, Taylor repeated words on average 2.57 times.

## Question 3: What topics are typically covered in Taylor‚Äôs songs?

Does Taylor Swift really sing about the same topics, or am I salty? To
find out, I use a method called [Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA)](https://eight2late.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/a-gentle-introduction-to-topic-modeling-using-r/).
LDA is a generative probabilistic model commonly used to model topics in
documents.

LDA assumes that each document is a mixture of topics, and each topic is
a mixture of words. It can be used for many different types of analyses.
The probabilistic model generated by LDA assigns probabilities to a word
falling under a given topic, and to a topic being assigned to a given
document.

I will treat each song as a ‚Äúdocument.‚Äù Before we dive into the
analysis, let‚Äôs look at the most frequent words in her collection.

      unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
      anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
      count(word, sort = TRUE)

Unusurpsingly, ‚Äúlove‚Äù clocks in at \#2. But let‚Äôs not throw Taylor under
the bus here. Is it really true that all of her songs are about
relationships and heartbreaks? Did she really need to reinvent herself
in 2017 (and 2014, and 2012‚Ä¶ you get the point) to escape that image?

    k <- 5 
    ldaOut.terms <- read.csv(file=paste("LDAGibbs_k=",k,"_TopicsToTerms.csv"))
    #topicProbabilities <- read.csv(file=paste0("LDAGibbs_k=",k,"_TopicProbabilities.csv"))
    #topic1ToTopic2 <- read.csv(file=paste0("LDAGibbs_k=",k,"_Topic1ToTopic2.csv"))

I used LDA to generate 5 topics, and each topic groups a set of words
together. The table below shpws that the topics don‚Äôt really have a
pattern (but Topic 3 clearly references ‚ÄúShake it Off‚Äù). Topic 2 appears
to cover the most romantic ground.

    ldaOut.terms <- ldaOut.terms[,2:length(ldaOut.terms)]

    ldaOut.terms

    ##   Topic.2 Topic.3 Topic.4 Topic.5
    ## 1    love     ooh    girl    feel
    ## 2    time   shake    home   wanna
    ## 3    stay    call     eye    yeah
    ## 4    hand    wait   forev   light
    ## 5     bad   gonna    hold    game

The last bit of analysis I want to cover is determining whether topics
occur more frequently over time. Is Taylor releasing songs that fall
under a given topic more frequntly? Might the topics represent an album?

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

![](tswift-post_files/figure-markdown_strict/last-1.png)

‚ÄúYear‚Äù and ‚ÄúTopic‚Äù do not appear to be correlated at all. The data show
that topics are spead out relatively evenly across years. Topic 5 seems
to be very prominent across songs in 2017. From the words assigned high
probability to Topic 5, including ‚Äúwanna,‚Äù ‚Äúfeel,‚Äù and ‚Äúgame,‚Äù might it
be the case that these songs are representative of Taylor‚Äôs increasing
agency?

LDA revealed much of what I already knew, in that the topics of Taylor
Swift‚Äôs songs tend to be associated with love, feelings, dreaming (of
the romantic sort), etc. I do feel like now I know a little more about
the patterns hidden underneath some of her most popular songs, and maybe
a little more about what makes them so catchy.
